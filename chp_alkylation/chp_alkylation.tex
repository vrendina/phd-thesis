 \section{Introduction}
\doublespacing
 The formation of \ce{C-O} bonds through the activation of \textit{sp$^2$} hybridized electrophiles
 has been extensively studied. Catalytic methods based on
 4-(dialkylamino)pyridines proceed through a well understood nucleophilic activation mechanism.\footnote{For mechanistic studies

 electrophiles with chiral Lewis bases.\footnote{{\frenchspacing France, S.; Guerin, D. J.; Miller,

 The Miller group has also found success using an imidaozle ring, part of a chiral tripeptide, as
 the nucleophilic activating moiety.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Miller, S. J.; Copeland, G. T.;

 With the exception of soluble iodide sources such as TBAI,
 catalytic nucleophilic activation of \textit{sp$^3$} hybridized electrophiles remains a largely

 Our original intent was to find a suitable nucleophilic activator for
 electrophiles with leaving groups attached directly to \textit{sp$^3$} hybridized carbons.
 Discovery of a small molecule catalyst capable of generating more reactive \textit{sp$^3$}
 electrophiles \textit{in situ}, and possibly even chiral electrophiles from achiral or racemic
 precursors, could have a broad impact on synthetic chemistry. In the ideal reaction, carbon, nitrogen, oxgen, and other atoms
 could serve as potential nucleophiles, allowing formation of \ce{C-C}, \ce{C-N}, and \ce{C-O}
 bonds (\refscheme{alkidealreaction}).

 \section{Discovery of a Catalyzed Reaction}
 \subsection{Initial Lewis-Base Screening}

 We began by screening a number of potential Lewis basic additives against mild etherification
 conditions.\footnote{Etherification reactions are typically carried out with the more nucleophilic
 alkoxide and an alkyl halide. (a) {\frenchspacing Williamson, A. Ueber die Theorie der
 Aetherbildung.
 \textit{Liebigs Ann. Chem.} \textbf{1851}, \textit{77}, 37-49.} (b) Feuer, H.; Hooz, J. Methods of Formation of
 the Ether Linkage. In \textit{The Chemistry of the Hydroxyl Group}; Patai, S., Ed.; Wiley: New
 York, 1967; pp 445-498.} In THF as solvent with a variety of weak bases (DIPEA, TMG, \ce{K2CO3}) to
 help scavenge the equivlent of HX produced, conversion to the target ether was never observed,
 even at elevated temperatures (\refscheme{alkinitiallewisbasescreen}). Alkylation of either the
 base or the additive was consistent with the formation of a precipitate in most cases, and the
 salts formed were not competent electrophiles.\footnote{An experiment with stoichiometric
 commercial trimethylsulfonium iodide did not show any methyl ether formation.} \begin{Scheme}[h]
 \centering
 \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{chp_alkylation/images/initiallewisbasescreen}
 \begin{textblock}{1}(3.35,-9) \cmp{alkaac} \end{textblock}
  \caption{Initial screening of Lewis bases affords no product in every case.}
  \label{sch:alkinitiallewisbasescreen}
\end{Scheme} 
 A screen of solvents (toluene, \ce{CH2Cl2}, DMF, \ce{CH3CN}) also did not lead to any productive
 reaction under the conditions tested. The use of stronger bases such as NaH or KH formed a much
 more reactive alkoxide nucleophile and even at low temperatures reactions proceeded rapidly to
 complete conversion without additives, leaving little room for catalysis. 
 
 When stoichiometric \ce{Ag2O} was employed as the base, a moderate increase in conversion
 was observed with catalytic dimethylsulfide or triphenylphosphine oxide present in the
 reaction mixture
 (\ref{cmp:alkaac}\ce{->}\ref{cmp:alkaad},
 \refscheme{alksilverscreen}).\crossref{ref:alkpossiblecat} The use of
 \ce{Ag2O} helps activate the electrophile by generating a highly insoluble silver halide
 salt, essentially functioning as a halide-specific Lewis acid.\footnote{For recent examples of
 alkylation reactions assisted by \ce{Ag2O} see:
 (a) {\frenchspacing Gouliaras, C.; Lee, D.; Chan, L.; Taylor, M. S. Regioselective Activation of Glycosyl Acceptors by a Diarylborinic Acid-Derived Catalyst. \textit{J. Am. Chem. Soc.}

Regioselective Alkylation of Carbohydrate Derivatives Catalyzed by a Diarylborinic Acid Derivative.
\textit{Org. Lett.} \textbf{2011}, \textit{13}, 3090-3093.}} The presence of sulfur or phosphine
oxide additives could potentially serve as silver(I) ligands, producing a more soluble silver
salt.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Daubinet, A. Design, Synthesis and Evaluation of Silver-Specific
Ligands.
Ph.D.
Dissertation, Rhodes University, Grahamstown, South Africa, 2001.}} This may explain why we observed
a subtle increase in conversion. We were wary of developing a reaction with
stoichiometric silver, and also had concerns that the additive was not actually functioning as a
nucleophilic activator.

\end{Scheme} 
 After looking at standard nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, selenium, and phosphorus centered Lewis
 bases and failing to observe any serious catalysis, we decided to examine carbon centered \textit{N}-hetereocyclic carbenes. In the presence of a suitable base, imidazolium and imidazolinium salts
 could be deprotonated to furnish the NHC.\footnote{(a) {\frenchspacing Sch\"onherr, H. J.; Wanzlick, H. W.

 5530-5534.}} We began by screening a variety of sterically and electronically differentiated
 commercially available imidazolium and imidazolinium salts (\refscheme{alkimidazoliumscreen}). When
 1-phenylethanol (\ref{cmp:alkaac}) was subjected to benzyl bromide and sodium
 \textit{tert}-butoxide in toluene as solvent, after two hours a 3\% yield of the target ether
 \ref{cmp:xcaa} was observed by $^1$H NMR. Salts bearing sterically hindered aryl groups
 (\ref{cmp:alkaae}, \ref{cmp:alkaaf}, and \ref{cmp:alkaag}) did not appear to provide any additional
 product. We were exceptionally pleased to see a 30\% yield with bis-adamantyl imidazolium
 \ref{cmp:alkaah}, a ten-fold increase in yield over the uncatalyzed reaction. The corresponding
 imidazolinium salt \ref{cmp:alkaai} delivered a marginal 7\% yield. The yield again increased to
 40\% with isobutyl substituted imidazolium \ref{cmp:alkaaj}. The bis-\textit{tert}-butyl
 (\ref{cmp:alkaak}) and bis-methyl (\ref{cmp:alkaal}) imidazolium salts were ineffective.
 Benzimidazolium \ref{cmp:alkaam} also provided no advantage over the uncatalyzed background
 reaction. The highest yields were obtained with bis-isopropyl imidazolium \ref{cmp:alkaan} (67\%)
 and bis-cyclohexyl imidazolium \ref{cmp:alkaao} (74\%). These data suggested that an unsaturated
 imidazolium ring and a secondary \textit{sp$^3$} hybridized carbon attached to the nitrogens were
 key structural features.

  \caption{Control reactions establish requirement of the imdazolium ring for catalysis.}
  \label{sch:alksaltcontrols}
\end{Scheme} 
 In order to establish that the imidazolium salt was in fact necessary for catalysis, we ran a
 series of control experiments (\refscheme{alksaltcontrols}). With sodium tetrafluoroborate or
 tetramethylphosphonium bromide present, less than 5\% yield of the product was observed. Other
 cationic heterocylic salts derived from 2,6-lutidine (\ref{cmp:alkaaq} and
 \ref{cmp:alkaar}) did not accelerate the reaction. Starting from the sodium alkoxide
 \ref{cmp:alkaap},\footnote{Formed by deprotonation of \ref{cmp:alkaac} with NaH in THF inside an inert atmosphere glovebox. The $\Delta\delta$
 ($\delta$\ref{cmp:alkaap}$-\delta$\ref{cmp:alkaac}) of the benzyllic methine proton by $^1$H NMR in
 toluene-\textit{d}$_8$ was $+$0.17 ppm after concentration and trituration with
 toluene.} which was fully soluble in toluene, a slightly higher 10\% yield was obtained in the
 absence of any catalyst.
 This result indicates that \textit{tert}-butanol present in the reaction mixture had a subtle
 inhibitory effect, presumably through hydrogen bonding to the nucleophile. These control reactions
 suggest that the nitrogen hetereocyclic plays a critical role in the reaction. Specifically,
 imidazolium heterocycles bearing the appropriate alkyl substituents were required to obtain any catalytic activity.

 \section{Mechanistic Studies}
  In the sections that follow, a discussion of the mechanism of this transformation will be
 presented. Several hypotheses were proposed and rigorously tested before finally arriving at a
 mechanism we believed to be consistent with the complete set of data. 
 
 
 \subsection{Preliminary Hypothesis Based on Electrophile Activation}
 Crystallographic evidence from the literature suggested that carbenes were capable of
 reacting as nucleophiles with various \textit{sp$^3$} hybridized electrophiles
 (\reffigure{alkknappkecrystals}).\footnote{(a) {\frenchspacing Knappke, C.

 \textit{Synthesis} \textbf{2011}, 3784-3795.} \label{ref:alkwangelin}} In 2010 and 2011 von
 Wangelin and coworkers treated aryl substituted imidazolium salts with potassium
 \textit{tert}-butoxide in THF solutions, forming the carbene, and then subsequently added various
 halide electrophiles. With an excess of base present ($>$2 equivalents), the products isolated resembled a
 deoxy Breslow intermediate,\footnote{(a) {\frenchspacing Breslow, R. On the Mechanism of Thiamine Action.

\textit{51}, 12370-12374.}} formed by alkylation at the C2 position of the imidazole ring followed
by further deprotonation at the benzylic position (\ref{cmp:alkaat}, right). The newly formed
double bond showed a length of 1.39 \AA\  in structure \ref{cmp:alkaat}, considerably longer than
the average C$_{sp^2}$\ce{=}C$_{sp^2}$ bond length (1.32 \AA),\footnote{{\frenchspacing Allen, F.

in Organic Compounds. \textit{J. Chem. Soc. Perk. T. 2} \textbf{1987}, S1-S19.}} suggesting the bond
contains significant charge-separated ylide character. The nucleophilic nature of the benzylic
position was confirmed by adding a second equivalent of electrophile, producing doubly alkylated
imidazolium salts (not shown). This type of reactivity mirrors that observed for Breslow
intermediates in Stetter and benzoin condensation reactions.\footnote{For a lead
reference see: {\frenchspacing Enders, D.; Balensiefer, T. Nucleophilic Carbenes in Asymmetric
Organocatalysis. \textit{Acc. Chem. Res.} \textbf{2004}, \textit{37}, 534-541.}} The protonated imidazolium salt
\ref{cmp:alkaas} (left) was obtained by adding TMSI to a solution containing residual
\textit{tert}-butanol from the carbene formation, liberating an equivalent of HI. Direct isolation
of \ref{cmp:alkaas} was complicated by the tendency to rapidly become deprotonated, necessitating an
acidic quench after formation of the alkylated species.

  \label{fig:alkknappkecrystals}
\end{figure} 

We had hoped that in the presence of a suitable nucleophile, an
intermediate akin to \ref{cmp:alkaas} could serve as an activated electrophile. Given the precedents
for carbenes to act as nucleophiles towards \textit{sp$^3$} electrophiles, we proposed the catalytic
cycle illustrated in \refscheme{alkactivationcycleone}. Stirring the imidazolium
salt \ref{cmp:alkaao} in toluene with sodium \textit{tert}-butoxide produces the carbene
(\ref{cmp:alkaao}\ce{->i}), entering the catalytic cycle. Addition of benzyl bromide forms the
activated electrophile (\textit{i}\ce{->}\textit{ii}), which can then either directly undergo
alkylation and regenerate the carbene (\textit{ii}\ce{->}\textit{i}), or become deprotonated
(\textit{ii}\ce{->}\textit{iii}) to form a species similar to \ref{cmp:alkaat}. Reprotonation from
from the secondary alcohol would generate an imidazolium alkoxide salt pair
(\textit{iii}\ce{->}\textit{iv}). The more nucleophilic alkoxide could then attack the activated
benzyl bromide, generating the ether product and releasing the carbene for further turnovers.  Prior to the addition of the electrophile, we observed the
formation of a purple solution (top right), likely indicating formation of the
carbene.\footnote{Non-transition metal carbene complexes are known to form colored solutions. (a)

{\frenchspacing Willans, C. E. Non-transition Metal \textit{N}-Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes.
\textit{Organomet. Chem.} \textbf{2010}, \textit{36}, 1-28.}} Upon addition of benzyl bromide to the carbene solution we \textit{immediately} observed the formation of a turbid bright yellow suspension (bottom right). We believed this was consistent with the formation of intermediate \textit{iii} and the precipitation of sodium bromide.

  \label{sch:alkactivationcycleone}
\end{Scheme}

In order to test this mechanistic hypothesis, we designed a series of deuterium labeling
experiments. To probe for the formation of intermediate \textit{iii} in the catalytic cyle, we ran
an experiment with \textit{d$_2$}-benzyl bromide (\ref{cmp:xcap}, \refscheme{alkdeprotonationexp}).
Our expectation was that if \textit{iii} was part of the productive catalytic cycle, we would see proton incorporation into the
ether product. The recovered product \ref{cmp:xcac} showed no incorporation of protons at the
benzylic position by $^1$H NMR spectroscopy, suggesting that \textit{iii} was not part of a productive pathway in the
catalytic cycle. Regardless, the formation of \textit{iii} was not integral to this mechanism being
operative, as proposed intermediate \textit{ii} could be directly alkylated without proceeding
through intermediate \textit{iii}.

We wanted to design an experiment to directly test whether or not the electrophile was being
activated through a nucleophilic displacement of the leaving group. In the proposed mechanism, the
electrophile would undergo two inversions at the site of the leaving group -- once upon addition of
the carbene (\textit{i}\ce{->}\textit{ii}) and again when the nucleophile attacks 
(\textit{iv}\ce{->}\textit{i}). Starting from a chiral optically pure alcohol and reacting that with
a chiral secondary electrophile would give different diastereomers of the product depending on the
mechanism (\refscheme{alkinversionexp}). Double inversion of the electrophile, a net retention of
the original configuration, would lead to a different diastereomer than direct S$_\mathrm{N}$2 substitution.
Alternatively, a 50:50 mixture of diastereomers would be indicative of an S$_\mathrm{N}$1 pathway.
While both (\textit{R})-- and (\textit{S})-$\alpha$-methylbenzyl bromide (R = \ce{CH3}) were known
compounds and could be readily prepared from the commercially available
chiral alcohol,\footnote{{\frenchspacing Chen, Y.; Tang, W.

hindered secondary electrophile were unsuccessful. We decided to target \textit{d$_1$}-benzyl
bromide (R = D) and were presented with the unique challenge of preparing a stereogenic center
containing a hydrogen and deuterium.

The material recovered was formed in a 60:40 dr based on integration of the $^1$H NMR signals for the benzylic hydrogen attached to the deuterated carbon. Assuming the reaction proceeded through a clean S$_\mathrm{N}$2 mechanism
under these conditions,\footnote{(a) {\frenchspacing Ashby, E. C.; Bae, D. H.; Park, W. S.;

\ref{cmp:xcao} would have been approximately 60:40 er.
We then ran the same experiment under our catalyzed conditions and were surprised to see that the ether was formed
with a nearly identical 61:39 dr, favoring the same diastereomer as the S$_\mathrm{N}$2 control
reaction. These data rule out the possibility of a double inversion mechanism, suggesting that a
pathway other than nucleophilic activation of the electrophile was operative.  



 \subsection{Second Hypothesis: Carbenes as Br\o nsted Bases}
 

 Imidazolium derived carbenes have been described as reasonably strong Br\o nsted
 bases, with p\textit{K}$_\mathrm{a}$ values of the conjugate acids ranging anywhere from 16-24 in
 DMSO.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Alder, R.
 W.; Allen, P.
 R.; Williams, S. J. Stable Carbenes as Strong Bases. \textit{J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Comm.} \textbf{1995},
 1267-1268.}} In 2005, the Movassaghi group reported an NHC catalyzed amidation reaction of
 unactivated esters with amino alcohols.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Movassaghi, M.; Schmidt, M. A.
 \textit{N}-Heterocyclic Carbene-Catalyzed Amidation of Unactivated Esters with Amino Alcohols.
 \textit{Org. Lett.} \textbf{2005}, \textit{7}, 2453-2456.} \label{ref:alkmovcrystal}} In the proposed mechanism, the amino alcohol was primed
 for nucleophilic attack by removing the alcohol proton with the NHC, generating a more
 nucleophilic alkoxide. Careful NMR studies showed that alcohols in the presence of NHCs exhibit a
 significant downfield shift for the \ce{O-H} proton. Movassaghi was also able to obtain a solid
 state structure of IMes complexed with methanol, which showed a nearly linear
 ($\angle$ \ce{C-H-O}, 174$^{\circ}$) hydrogen bond interaction between the methanol and C2 position
 of the imidazolylidene ring (\ref{cmp:alkaau}, \refscheme{alkbronstedbasecycle}). The Scheidt
 group more recently introduced an NHC catalyzed intermolecular \textit{oxa}-Michael
 reaction, where they also propose a Br\o nsted base role for the NHC.\footnote{{\frenchspacing

 observed a marginal level of enantioselectivity with a chiral NHC, suggesting that the proton may
 not be fully transferred to the NHC or the imidazolium alkoxide ion-pair was closely associated. 
 
 The proposed catalytic cycle for a Br\o nsted base mechanism, illustrated in
 \refscheme{alkbronstedbasecycle}, again opens with deprotonation of the imidazolium salt
 \ref{cmp:alkaao} to deliver the carbene (\ref{cmp:alkaao}\ce{->i}). The secondary alcohol enters
 the catalytic cycle, forming neutral alcohol carbene complex \textit{ii}. The activated alcohol
 displaces the bromide, forming the ether product and regenerating the imidazolium salt  (\textit{ii}\ce{->}\textit{iii}). The carbene can then be regenerated by deprotonating with an
 additional equivalent of sodium \textit{tert}-butoxide (\textit{iii}\ce{->}\textit{i}).

  \caption{Crystal structures of C2 alkylated imidazolium salts prepared during this study.}
  \label{fig:alkalkylatedimidazolium}
\end{figure}
 To test this mechanistic hypothesis we were curious if intermediate \textit{iii}, the imidazolium
 salt, could be recovered after the reaction by reprotonating the carbene. The imidazolium
 salt \ref{cmp:alkaao} was virtually insoluble in \ce{Et2O} and fully soluble in \ce{CH2Cl2}, so by
 selective extraction we hoped to cleanly recover the salt.
 At the conclusion of the reaction we concentrated the mixture and removed any organic soluble materials by washing with \ce{Et2O}. The remaining material was dissolved in \ce{CH2Cl2}
 and filtered away from sodium bromide. We were surprised to see that after concentration of the
 \ce{CH2Cl2}, the only salt recovered was doubly alkylated imidazolium \ref{cmp:xcad} in $>$90\%
 purity by $^1$H NMR spectroscopy (\refscheme{alkcatalystrecovery}). The structure of \ref{cmp:xcad}
 was confirmed by careful analysis of the spectral data and ultimately by X-ray crystallography
 (\reffigure{alkalkylatedimidazolium}, left).
 In no situation did we ever recover any of the starting imidazolium salt \ref{cmp:alkaao}.
 When we ran the same experiment with \textit{d}$_2$-benzyl bromide and quenched the reaction with
 methanol, the recovered salt contained only two deuteriums (\ref{cmp:xcae}). A proton was
 incorporated at the benzylic methine carbon, indicating that it was deprotonated at some point
 during the reaction.
 These data seemed to support a mechanism comparable to the original proposal based on a
 nucleophilic activation role for the carbene (\refscheme{alkactivationcycleone}, page
 \pageref{sch:alkactivationcycleone}).
 


We were able to independently synthesize an authentic sample of the doubly alkylated imidazolium
salt
\ref{cmp:xcad} in high yield by adding excess sodium \textit{tert}-butoxide and benzyl bromide to a
THF solution of \ref{cmp:alkaao}. With sufficient quantities of material in hand, we carried out a
series of experiments to try to understand the role of the alkylated imidazolium
(\refscheme{alkdibenzylcontrols}). In the absence of benzyl bromide and with stoichiometric
\ref{cmp:xcad} none of the desired product was detectable, consistent with the previous experiment which showed the
reaction proceeds through an S$_\mathrm{N}$2 pathway (\refscheme{alkinversionexpspectra}, page
\pageref{sch:alkinversionexpspectra}). Transfer of a benzyl group from \ref{cmp:xcad} would require
a double inversion of the electrophile which was formerly ruled out. With a catalytic amount of
\ref{cmp:xcad} and 1.5 equivalents of benzyl bromide the yield increased to 70\%, a result
suspiciously similar to the yield obtained with the parent imidazolium salt \ref{cmp:alkaao} (74\%). 
 \begin{Scheme}[b]

    \caption{Experiments with C2 alkylated imidazolium salt \ref{cmp:xcad}.}
  \label{sch:alkdibenzylcontrols}
\end{Scheme}

Given that we recovered \ref{cmp:xcae} (\refscheme{alkcatalystrecovery}) with a proton incorporated
at the benzylic methine position, this data point seemed to suggest a role for an anion adjacent to
the imidazolium ring. We attempted to prepare a catalyst with a quaternary carbon attached to the C2
position of the imidazolium to remove any hydrogens. Exposure of \ref{cmp:alkaao} to 5 equivalents
of methyl iodide and 4 equivalents of potassium \textit{tert}-butoxide did not deliver the
anticipated quaternary substituted imidazolium salt even with prolonged heating and sonication of
the heterogeneous mixture (\ce{->}\ref{cmp:alkaav}, \refscheme{alkisopropylimidazoliumprep}).
Instead, a 69\% isolated yield of the isopropyl substituted salt \ref{cmp:xcag} was obtained. A
solid state structure of the tetraphenyl borate salt (\ref{cmp:xcai}, \reffigure{alkalkylatedimidazolium})
showed that significant amount of allylic strain would be generated upon introduction of the
\textit{tert}-butyl group, likely explaining why the reaction failed to introduce an
additional methyl group.\footnote{The \ce{C16-C1-N2-C10} dihedral angle was 5.2$^{\circ}$ in the
solid state structure.
See the appendix for further details.} Carrying out the reaction with a catalytic amount of
isopropyl substituted imidazolium iodide salt \ref{cmp:xcag} delivered the ether product in 82\%
yield, the highest yield observed up to this point. While this data point does not rule out the possible involvement of the proton adjacent to
the imidazolium ring, it does point to a mechanistic pathway that does not require the involvement
of a C2 carbene.

 \subsection{Loosely Associated Ion-Pair Mechanism}
 The experiments in the previous two sections showed that an intermediate involving
a carbene in the catalytic cycle was highly unlikely. Alkylation of the imidazolium ring at the C2
position effectively blocks the formation of a carbene,\footnote{Abnormal carbenes at the C4 or C5
positions of imidazoliums have been reported but we did not believe this was a likely
intermediate.
{\frenchspacing Arnold, P.
L.; Pearson, S.
Abnormal
\textit{N}-Heterocyclic Carbenes. \textit{Coordin. Chem. Rev.} \textbf{2007}, \textit{251}, 596-609.}} yet the salts were still competent
catalysts. We were still curious if there was a role for the benzylic methine proton adjacent to the
imidazolium ring. A study of base loading versus yield of \ref{cmp:alkaac} revealed a linear
increase (R$^2$ = 0.99) in yield up to 1.3 equivalents of base, and a significant drop in yield
beyond 1.4 equivalents (\reffigure{alkbaseloadingstudy}). The reaction was highly sensitive even to
subtle changes in the amount of base, suggesting a proton transfer event may be critical in the
reaction mechanism.

We were able to cleanly deprotonate dibenzylated imidazolium bromide salt \ref{cmp:xcad} with sodium
\textit{tert}-butoxide in toluene, conditions comparable to our standard reaction conditions
(\refscheme{alkylidepreparation}).
After filtration inside an inert atmosphere glove box to remove any residual \ref{cmp:xcad} and
sodium bromide, concentration afforded a pure dark green solid in 70\% yield
(\ce{->}\ref{cmp:xcal}).
Dilute toluene or benzene solutions of \ref{cmp:xcal} were bright yellow, consistent with some of the earlier color changes observed in the
reaction (\refscheme{alkactivationcycleone}, page \pageref{sch:alkactivationcycleone}). The $^1$H
and $^{13}$C NMR data for \ref{cmp:xcal} showed considerable \textit{C}$_s$ symmetry, indicative of
significant ylide or single bond character. The symmetry could be the result of free rotation, or an orthogonal
relationship between the phenyl groups and the imidazole ring.

\end{Scheme}

To test the catalytic activity of \ref{cmp:xcal}, we subjected it to two different experiments.
Under standard conditions with 1-phenylethanol, a substantially lower 25\% yield of ether
\ref{cmp:xcaa} was observed (\refscheme{alkylidecontrols}, top). In contrast, the protonated
imidazolium salt \ref{cmp:xcad} gave a 70\% yield in the same time frame under identical conditions. The 25\% yield was still higher than the uncatalyzed background
reaction, suggesting that ylide \ref{cmp:xcal} could be a resting state of the more active
imidazolium catalyst that can slowly re-enter the catalytic cycle upon protonation. The base loading study was also
consistent with this observation. Higher loadings of base lead to a decrease in yield, presumably by
funnelling more of the catalyst to the less active deprotonated form. Starting with the sodium
alkoxide of 1-phenylethanol delivered the product in a marginal 13\% yield, within experimental error of the
uncatalyzed background reaction. The same reaction with imidazolium salt \ref{cmp:xcad} afforded a
significantly augmented 87\% yield.  When we attempted to form the analogous ylide with \ref{cmp:xcag}, $<$2\%
conversion occured in 24 hours by $^1$H NMR (\ce{->}\ref{cmp:alkaaw}, \refscheme{alkisopropylylide}). The
slightly higher yield obtained with \ref{cmp:xcag} (82\% versus 70\% with \ref{cmp:xcad}) could be
attributed to the fact that the isopropyl group methine proton was significantly less acidic and
production of the deactivated form of the catalyst was not as facile.

    \caption{Proposed mechanism consistent with all of the data points.}
  \label{sch:alkcounterionmechbenzyl}
\end{Scheme}


The experimental evidence points to the mechanistic proposal illustrated in
\refscheme{alkcounterionmechbenzyl}. Before entering the catalytic cycle, \ref{cmp:alkaao} rapidly
undergoes double benzylation to produce the active catalyst (\ref{cmp:alkaao}\ce{->}\textit{i}). The sodium alkoxide of the secondary alcohol, in
equilibrium with sodium \textit{tert}-butoxide, exchanges for the bromide counter-ion causing sodium
bromide to precipitate from the reaction mixture (\textit{i}\ce{->}\textit{ii}). The alkoxide, now
paired with a weakly associated and diffuse counter-ion, displaces benzyl bromide to deliver the
product and regenerate the catalyst (\textit{ii}\ce{->}\textit{i}). Alternatively, the catalyst can be
deprotonated by sodium \textit{tert}-butoxide to generate the inactive ylide form
(\textit{i}\ce{->}\textit{iii}). The ylide can slowly re-enter the catalytic cycle upon protonation
from the secondary alcohol (\textit{iii}\ce{->}\textit{ii}).

During the course of our studies, we had also prepared a series of catalysts with different
counter-ions and were initially perplexed by the results (\refscheme{alkweakcounterions}). Catalysts with larger and more weakly coordinating
ions lead to diminishing yields of \ref{cmp:xcaa}. Our hope was that by increasing the solubility of
the catalyst, we should see a corresponding increase in the yield. The critical step in the proposed
mechanism requires the formation of an imidazolium alkoxide ion-pair (\textit{i}\ce{->}\textit{ii}). The formation of the integral ion-pair could be driven by the precipitation of sodium bromide, and with

\section{Transition State Structure Experiments}

Previous screening had shown that commercially available aryl-substituted imidazolium salts
containing \textit{ortho} substitution were not competent catalysts
(\refscheme{alkimidazoliumscreen}, page \pageref{sch:alkimidazoliumscreen}). Given the new
information about the mechanism, it was plausible that these catalysts were inactive because they
could not form the active doubly-alkylated catalyst \textit{in situ}.

\end{figure}
We prepared an authentic sample of doubly-benzylated IMes (\ref{cmp:xcaf},
\reffigure{alkmescrystalandlumo}, left) and found that even with pre-alkylation, the catalyst was
not active. However, the solid state structure of \ref{cmp:xcaf} led to a hypothesis about the method of
interaction between the imidazolium and alkoxide. Low level computation modeling of the imidazolium
LUMO  showed a large coefficient centered on the C2 position between
the two nitrogens (\reffigure{alkmescrystalandlumo}, right). It was possible that the \textit{ortho}
substitution on the aryl groups blocked access to the LUMO, weakening the interaction between the catalyst and alkoxide.\footnote{Attempts to
prepared other unhindered and electronically modified aryl-imidazolium salts (aryl = phenyl,
\textit{p}-\ce{OCH3} phenyl, \textit{p}-\ce{NO2} phenyl) were unsuccessful.} While this would
generate a less nucleophilic alkoxide, we hypothesized that the formation of a neutral C2 adduct
could be a solubilizing interaction in the low dielectric solvent. \begin{Scheme}[t]

     \caption{NMR data indicates alkoxide not bound to C2 position.}

\end{Scheme}

A covalent interaction between the alkoxide and imidazolium was tested by a series of NMR
experiments (\refscheme{alklumoadditionnmr}). Covalent interaction between the imidazolium C2 and
alkoxide would dearomatize the ring and lead to significant differences in the chemical
shifts relative to the halide salts.  Treatment of imidazolium iodide \ref{cmp:xcag} with
freshly prepared \ce{NaOCH3} showed effectively no change in the proton and carbon NMR chemical
shifts (\ce{->}\ref{cmp:alkaax}). Furthermore, proton NMR data for \ref{cmp:xcad} and the
corresponding methoxide salt \ref{cmp:alkaay}\footnote{Prepared by adding methanol to ylide
\ref{cmp:xcal}.
See the experimental section for characterization data.} exhibited identical proton shifts in methanol for the C4 and C5 hydrogens.
These experiments do not completely rule out the possibility of a fleeting covalent interaction in a highly unfavorable equilibrium with the
dissociated form. For solubility reasons, methanol was used as the solvent for these experiments.
The use of methanol could discourage formation of the neutral dearomatized adduct \ref{cmp:alkaax} by
stabilizing the charge separated form. This appears to be the case with \ref{cmp:xcad} and
\ref{cmp:alkaax}, as there is essentially no difference in the proton spectra even with the
different counterions. 

In an attempt to understand how intimately associated the imidazolium alkoxide ion-pair was, a
\textit{C}$_2$-symmetric chiral catalyst (\ref{cmp:xcak}) was prepared to look for any kinetic
resolution of the secondary alcohol (\reftable{alkchiralcat}). We were pleased to see with 1.3
equivalents of sodium \textit{tert}-butoxide the reaction rapidly reached complete conversion
(entry 1). Dropping the base loading to 0.75 equivalents delivered the product in 55\% yield,
consistent with 0.2 equivalents of base consumed during the formation of the doubly-alkylated active
catalyst. Unfortunately both the product (\ref{cmp:xcaa}) and starting material (\ref{cmp:alkaac})
were racemic (entry 2). Carrying out the reaction at lower temperatures also did not
afford material in any detectable levels of enantioselectivity (entries 3 and 4). These data suggest
that  the ions were weakly associated in a manner that was poorly organized.\footnote{Several other
secondary alcohols were tested and all in all cases racemic starting materials and products
were recovered.}

Computations on imidazolium methoxide geometries in toluene solution lead to another plausible
hypothesis for the how the two ions interact in solution. Geometry optimization calculations seemed
to suggest that there was a considerable degree of hydrogen bonding between the C4 imidazolium
hydrogen and the alkoxide (\reffigure{alkimidazoliumalkoxidecalc}).  The C4--H bond length of
1.20 \AA\  was signifcantly elongated relative to the C5--H bond length of just 1.08 \AA. The solid
state structures of \ref{cmp:xcad} (page \pageref{cmp:xcad}) and \ref{cmp:xcaf} (page
\pageref{cmp:xcaf}) also seemed to show the halide counter-ion associated with a single C4 hydrogen.\footnote{Carbon hydrogen bond lengths were not accurately determined in the solid state
structures. The orientation of the halide relative to the imidazolium ring may have simply been the
result of a preferred crystal packing orientation. See the appendix for details.} Reexamining the
data for the catalysts illustrated in \reffigure{alkimidazoliumalkoxidecalc} showed a clear trend.
The most successful catalysts were those with unsaturated \textit{sp}$^2$ hybridized backbones
containing two hydrogens. When we recorded NMR data for ylide \ref{cmp:xcal} in deuterated methanol
we expected to see deuterium incorporated at the benzylic methine position, but we were surprised to
see that the signals associated with the C4 and C5 positions also exchanged
(\ce{->}\ref{cmp:xcam}, \refscheme{alkdeuteriumexchange}, top).

Exposure of imidazolium \ref{cmp:xcag} to sodium \textit{tert}-butoxide in deuterated methanol
showed a slow 55\% exchange of \textit{only} the backbone hydrogens in 12 hours
(\ce{->}\ref{cmp:alkaaz}, \refscheme{alkdeuteriumexchange}, bottom). Weak \ce{C-H\bond{...}O}
hydrogen bonds are known to exist and given the propensity for these hydrogens to exchange under basic conditions, we
believed this might be a plausible secondary interaction between the catalyst and alkoxide.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Taylor, R.; Kennard, O.

While there was good evidence that the hydrogens may be important, we needed to prepare an
imidazolium salt with alkyl substitution at the C4 and C5 positions. Synthesizing a
penta-substituted imidazolium proved to be a significant challenge, but through the use of microwave chemistry we were
able to access 4,5-dimethyl imidazolium \ref{cmp:xcanb}
(\refscheme{alkdibenzylscreen}).\footnote{{\frenchspacing Wolkenberg, S. E.; Wisnoski, D. D.;

These data points
confirm that the backbone hydrogens were not an integral catalyst feature and suggest that the
alkoxide interaction was predominantly ionic in nature.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Macchioni, A. Ion

 Numerous examples of stereoselective reactions catalyzed
by chiral ion-pairs have been reported in the literature. Strategies based on
phase-transfer catalysis are among the most common and well studied.\footnote{For pioneering reports

More recently the Jacobsen group and others have utilized chiral thioureas as ``anion-binding''
catalysts to generate chiral ion pairs with cationic substrates.\footnote{For lead references see:

Future chiral catalyst designs, based on these mechanistic studies the aforementioned reports from
the literature, will likely need to incorporate more functional groups that can engange in
well-defined non-covalent secondary interactions (H-bonding, cation-$\pi$, $\pi$-$\pi$, etc\ldots) to create more organized
transition states.

In summary, we have laid the groundwork for a new class of cationic organocatalysts that are capable
of constructing \ce{C-O} bonds. Careful mechanistic studies first ruled out the possible
involvment of carbenes and lead to the discovery of unusual C2 alkylated imidazolium
salts.\crossref{ref:alkwangelin} Further mechanistic experiments showed that the reaction can be
catalyzed by penta-substituted imidazolium salts, suggesting the catalyst interacts in largely ionic
fashion with the substrate. While catalytic Williamson ether reactions are known under phase
transfer conditions, our approach requires only a single organic liquid
phase.\footnote{{\frenchspacing Tan, S. N.; Dryfe, R. A.; Girault, H. H. Electrochemical Study of
Phase-Transfer Catalysis Reactions: The Williamson Ether Synthesis. \textit{Helv. Chim. Acta.}
\textbf{1994}, \textit{77}, 231-242.}} Developing novel chiral imidazolium
salts will be the subject of future work in this area and results will be forthcoming.
